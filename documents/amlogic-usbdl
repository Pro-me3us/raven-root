This tool exploits a vulnerability in the USB download mode to load and run unsigned code in Secure World.

	Odroid N2+ (s922x)
	FireTV 2nd gen Cube (s922x)

Usage

./amlogic-usbdl <input_file> [<output_file>]
	input_file: payload binary to load and execute (max size 65282 bytes)
	output_file: file to write data returned by payload

Payloads

Payloads are raw binary AArch64 executables. Some are provided in directory payloads/.
